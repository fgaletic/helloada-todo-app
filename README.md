## Constraints and Future Plans

- Split the main router into separate routers for better organization and scalability.
- Add more routes to handle additional functionality and features.

## Plans to Use JWT

- Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.
- JWT provides a secure way to authenticate users and protect routes.
- It allows for stateless authentication, making it suitable for RESTful APIs.
- JWT tokens can be easily validated and decoded, providing a reliable authentication mechanism.
