5. Technical Choices

   Database Selection: MongoDB vs. SQL

   For this project, we chose MongoDB over traditional SQL databases for the following reasons:

   - Flexibility: MongoDB, being a NoSQL database, allows for flexible schema design. This is particularly useful for a todo application where task structures can vary and evolve over time.
   - Scalability: MongoDB's horizontal scaling capabilities make it suitable for handling large amounts of data and high-traffic applications.
   - Ease of Use: MongoDB's JSON-like document storage is intuitive and aligns well with the application's data model, simplifying the development process.

6. Future Plans

   Application Structure

   - Router Improvements: Split the main router into separate routers for better organization and scalability.
   - Additional Routes: Add more routes to handle new features and functionalities.

   Authentication with JWT

   - JWT Integration: Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.
   - Security: JWT provides a secure way to authenticate users and protect routes.
   - Stateless Authentication: Ideal for RESTful APIs, as JWT allows for stateless authentication.
   - Easy Validation: JWT tokens can be easily validated and decoded, offering a reliable authentication mechanism.

7. Deployment

   Serverless Deployment on Koyeb:

   - Scalability: Koyeb offers serverless infrastructure, allowing the application to scale efficiently based on demand.
   - Cost Optimization: Serverless functions and container management help in optimizing costs.

   Frontend Hosting on Netlify:

   - Continuous Deployment: Netlify provides seamless CI/CD, ensuring that new updates are deployed automatically.
   - CDN-Powered Hosting: Netlifyâ€™s CDN-powered hosting ensures fast and reliable delivery of the application to users.
